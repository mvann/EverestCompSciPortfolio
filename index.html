            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>This is my website, created for the Everest computer science expedition. Everest is a public high school in Redwood City, California that, for eight weeks a year, 
                hosts multiple different types of classes called expeditions. These classes are a replacement for electives so that during most of the year the school can focus on the core classes.
                This class is Computer Science and Information Technology.</p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p> The purpose of this class is to learn different programming languages and the greater applications of those languages. The languages that we are learning are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Html
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSS
                </li>
                <li>
                    Javascript
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>On this web page I have created a short biography on myself, an introduction to Html, and a description of different computer parts and their purpose in a computer.
            I have also created links to the projects that I have completed in this class.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Other projects that I've done but I haven't included as pages in this website. </p>
