            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the primary programming language that websites are written in. HTML is based off of the use of tags which are parts
                of code that dictate how the webpage will look and react. Tags look like this &lt;tag&gt; with different words inside that signify different things. For instance the way that
                all HTML websites start is with an html tag: &lt;html&gt;. In addition, most tags must be closed to show that that tag is no longer active. That is shown with a closing tag that looks 
                like this &lt;/tag&gt;.</p>
            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS styles the webpages by giving certain attributes to different elements of a webpage. For instance, you could use CSS to say that all
                div tags (&lt;div&gt;, a tag that creates a box in the webpage) must be a certain width and height. The usefulness of a stylesheet is that you only need one for an entire website
                which means that if you change something on the stylesheet it would change things on every webpage that uses the stylesheet.</p>
            <h3>Some important tags:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>&lt;div&gt;</h4>
                    <p>Div stands for division, as in a division in a webpage. When a division is placed in a webpage it now represents that part of the webpage. A div's width and height can
                        be adjusted as well as many other attributes. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>&lt;p&gt;</h4>
                    <p>p stands for paragraph and this tag is fairly self-explanatory. Whatever is written after a &lt;p&gt; is placed will be a paragraph until the paragraph is closed with a &lt;/p&gt; </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>&lt;body&gt;</h4>
                    <p>This tag represents everything that displays on the webpage. Every paragraph and div goes in here.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>&lt;head&gt;</h4>
                    <p>The head tag is used before the body. It contains certain information about the webpage and is where you connect an html file to a CSS. Inside it also contains the 
                        title tag which is what displays at the very top of the window. Most things inside of the head tag are never seen by the viewer of the website.
                    </p>
